'''Letters in some of the SOS messages are altered by cosmic radiation during transmission. Given the signal received by Earth as a string, , determine how many letters of the SOS message have been changed by radiation.

Example


The original message was SOSSOS. Two of the message's characters were changed in transit.

Function Description

Complete the marsExploration function in the editor below.

marsExploration has the following parameter(s):

string s: the string as received on Earth
Returns

int: the number of letters changed during transmission
Input Format

There is one line of input: a single string, .

Constraints

 will contain only uppercase English letters, ascii[A-Z].
Sample Input 0

SOSSPSSQSSOR
Sample Output 0

3
Explanation 0

 = SOSSPSSQSSOR, and signal length . They sent  SOS messages (i.e.: ).

Expected signal: SOSSOSSOSSOS
Recieved signal: SOSSPSSQSSOR
Difference:          X  X   X
Sample Input 1

SOSSOT
Sample Output 1

1
Explanation 1

 = SOSSOT, and signal length . They sent  SOS messages (i.e.: ).

Expected Signal: SOSSOS     
Received Signal: SOSSOT
Difference:           X
Sample Input 2

SOSSOSSOS
Sample Output 2

0
Explanation 2

Since no character is altered, return 0.'''
